stripwidth guessing

--shred
   A way to easily generate test cases
      (combine with --stripwidth)

--threshold for 'goodness' of a ranking (vs. other strips)
   A "match" must be <0.6 better than any other match to be considers 'accurate'

Other distance metrics?
   Currently Euclidean RGB.  What about YUV? Or perception based?
   Do they make a difference?
   At least an excuse for me to play with colour spaces

Any other 'simple' matching algorithms?

Come up with an actual "find leftmost slice" algorithm
    - Existing solutions use:
       - the slice that generates the longest 'path' (cycles?)
       - the slice that has the largest error for left neighbour
          => But we have internal slices with larger error values :(
             (stupid black and white tokyo skyscraper)

Check that list of slices has no cliques?  Although I have yet to see a test
case that does.
