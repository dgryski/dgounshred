stripwidth guessing

--threshold for 'goodness' of a ranking (vs. other strips)
   A "match" must be <0.6 better than any other match to be considers 'accurate'

Other distance metrics?
   Currently Euclidean RGB.  What about YUV? Or perception based?
   Do they make a difference?
   At least an excuse for me to play with colour spaces

Any other 'simple' matching algorithms?

Check that list of slices has no cliques?  Although I have yet to see a test
case that does.
